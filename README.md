# Fourier Visualization
Encoding a visualization of the Fourier transform to enrich my inuitions about it.

## Built With
- Dash
- Python

## Hopefuls
- [ ] Create a button that adds new input fields, each of whose inputs controls a new line on the graph (or perhaps creates a new graph, re-spacing the graphs on the DOM?).
- [ ] Sum up the sine waves to create a new sine wave.
- [ ] Represent each sine wave as a phasor (a vector spinning round in a circle).
- [ ] Give these phasors the correct size, and concatenate them into a larger spirograph.
- [ ] Show how this relates to the original sum-graph.
